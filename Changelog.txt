Initialised repository.
Added Segmenter2 family of template classes allowing storing and file IO of Segments.

Code now compiles but needs to be tested.

--------------------------------------------------------
Rewritten to take account of how any sane segmentation will need to store the
segmentation next to the vertex in addition to centrally.
Storing the segmentation as a per-vertex property also removes the need for a
complicated redefinition of OpenMesh::IO::binary<MeshSegmentT<MeshType>>.

Expanded Segmenter2.hh
Added GUI components to firstPlugin.hh and firstPlugin.cc (still needs
slot definition and linking)
