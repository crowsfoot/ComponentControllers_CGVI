-------------------------------------------------------
Added Folder Plugin-ComponentControllers
Added Files:
	-ComponentControllers.hh
		Implementation of features in MeshSegmentT and
		MeshSegmentCollectionT with an emphasis on making it less
		confusing
	-ComponentControllersPlugin.*
		Header and object files for the GUI implementation of
		ComponentControllers.hh

Broke Segmenter2.* into MeshSegmentT.* and MeshSegmentCollectionT.*
Segmenter now keeps colours per vertex for each segment.
Wrote code to bypass the standard OpenFlipper load/save wrapper functions to
OpenMesh::IO in order toread in custom mesh properties for storing
segmentation.
Added functions for restoring the Segment collections from a property stored with a vertex.

Finished debugging MeshSegment* template classes.
Added incomplete routines implementing PCA and best-fit bounding box with the Alglib library.
Changed storage routine to simpler by-vertex already supported by OpenMesh,
removing need for the SegmentIO code.

--------------------------------------------------------
Initialised repository.
Added Segmenter2 family of template classes allowing storing and file IO of Segments.

Code now compiles but needs to be tested.

06 May 2012- David Lane
--------------------------------------------------------
Rewritten to take account of how any sane segmentation will need to store the
segmentation next to the vertex in addition to centrally.
Storing the segmentation as a per-vertex property also removes the need for a
complicated redefinition of OpenMesh::IO::binary<MeshSegmentT<MeshType>>.

Expanded Segmenter2.hh
Added GUI components to firstPlugin.hh and firstPlugin.cc (still needs
slot definition and linking)
